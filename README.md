# Library_Management
GUI of Library Management System using Tikinter
This project involves creating a Library Book Management System using Python's Tkinter library for the front-end GUI and SQLite for the backend database. The application is designed to have a single window tkinter GUI where users can perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on a 'books' database. The window will have text widgets for entering and displaying book title, author, year of publication, and optional ISBN. Additionally, a large text area or list box will be used to display records that match the search criteria. Users can add new books, view existing records, update book details, and delete records through the graphical user interface. The SQLite database will store the book information and handle the necessary operations to maintain the library book records.
